# 🦆 CryptoDucks: Authentication & Authorization in React

## Project Overview

CryptoDucks is a secure React application designed to explore authentication and authorization setup. This project provides a streamlined login, registration, and private routing experience. Users can log in, view their unique profile, and explore the world of crypto ducks, all within a safe and structured authentication framework.

A React app built with Vite. Used by the TripleTen Software Engineering Bootcamp to demonstrate the frontend authorization and authentication.

## Key Features Include:

- 📝 **User Registration**: Users can register for a new account securely with validated information.

- 🔐 **User Login**: Registered users can log in to access sensitive information on crypto ducks.

- 🚪 **User Logout**: Secure logout functionality ensures users can safely exit the application.

- 👮‍♂️ **Authentication & Authorization**: Protected routes for /ducks and /my-profile components ensure only authenticated users have access.

## Technologies Used

- ⚛️ **React**: Built with React for a seamless user interface and component-based architecture.

- 📝 **JavaScript**: Core logic and functionality implemented with JavaScript.

- ⚡ **Vite**: Powered by Vite for fast development and optimized build performance.

- 🔑 **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure tokens are used to validate user sessions and safeguard user data.

- 🛣️ **React Router**: Efficient routing setup allows for smooth navigation and protected routes.

## Usage

Clone the repo, install node modules, and run `npm run dev` to get started.

I plan on enhancing the project by expanding the profile component to allow users to update their information, including profile pictures, bio, and personal preferences. I'd like to also increase security by adding an optional 2FA setup during login, providing users with additional protection for sensitive data. Other ideas I have are to add a marketplace so users can buy and sell their crypto ducks using in-app tokens and search/filter options.
